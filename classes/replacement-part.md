This class is designed as an overview of fundamental skills used in designing and manufacturing parts. We will develop an idea of how to translate our ideas into detailed measured drawings. Then we will use computer software (Fusion 360) to pring those drawings into a three dimensional computer repesentation. Finalally, we will translate the model into instructions suitable for a 3d printer. Following these steps will allow you to transform your ideas precisely into real world objects
