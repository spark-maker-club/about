Making an electronic device can seems intimidating but by breaking down the steps into managable pieces the whole process becomes much simpler. This class gices students the opportunity to make a macro pad, or a very small keyboard that helps automate tasks. We will cover some basic electrical information to start. We will then take a practical look at thse rules by building and measuring some simple circuits. Then we will see how even these simple building blocks can come together in a fully designed project. We will then assemble our macro boards based on the designs we studied. This project is designed to give the students plenty of practice soldering and a good enough understanding of electronics to start poking around with theior own circuits.

Here are the topics covered in this lesson:

- Basic electrical concepts
- Understanding circuit diagrams
- Circuit prototyping with breadboards
- Soldering and printed circuit board construction
- Microcontroller scripts and configuration
