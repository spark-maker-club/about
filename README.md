# Community

## Showcase

Let everyone know what you are working on or what you have finished. We provide our members with space to show off. It's a great place to find inspiration as well.

## Colaboration

If something has you blocked on your preject, let others know with our stuck board. Maybe someone else can help get you over that hurdle or just has an answer to your question.

## Bounty Board

If you or someone in the local area needs help, they can post it to the bounty board. They need to setup a reward with us ahead of time. When someone completes the bounty they get something cool like, free membership for a month or prints.
